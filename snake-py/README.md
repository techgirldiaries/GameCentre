Simple Snake game used for educational purposes.

### Description
This started as a project to build a simple game using Python. As I learn more, I will improve the application, and now its just something to fool around with. After finding GitHub, this was the only "useful" project to upload as to test out GitHub. I plan to improve it where I can.

### Changelog

# 1.0
Added ability to read from file. First attempt to Snake!
# 1.1
Fixes isues and performance improvements.
