# Tetris-Basic
This is a simple no nonsense version of Tetris that has no styling - made for the support of my Udemy Video.  Also viewable [here](https://youtu.be/w1JJfK09ujQ)


In this course, you will learn how to set up a project from scratch using the Atom code editor and your command prompt tool, as well as gain a fundamental understanding of JavaScript by building your very own version of Tetris.

This is a great course for those of you who have never touched code before or those of you with some basic understanding of JavaScript, that would like to go over the fundamentals again.

This course consists of explainer videos that will run you through concepts such as 'Explaining Variables', 'What is a Function and how we use it', 'Understanding Arrays', and many more. These explainer videos are dotted throughout the Tetris project and play when we start to discover each javaScript concept or method. These explainer videos consist of imagery and diagrams for those of you who are visual learners. There are also multiple-choice questions at the end of selected lectures.
